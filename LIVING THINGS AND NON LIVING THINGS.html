    <h4>Growing up children, one of the major topics treated in Elementary Science class is LIVING THINGS AND NON-LIVING THINGS</h4>
</p>
<p>However, you ll agree with me that uptil now Living and Non-living things make up our sorrounding today</P>

<h2>A quick glance at Living and Non Living Things</h2>
<p>We can find many things around us, from mountains and oceans to plants and animals. The earth in which we live is made up of several things.  These “things” can be categorized into two different types – Living and Non-living Things.

    <ul>
        <li>All living things breathe, eat, grow, move, reproduce and have senses. </li>
    <li>Non-living things do not eat, grow, breathe, move and reproduce. They do not have senses.</li>
</ul>
Living things have “life,” though some might not show its evident signs. For instance, a tree would probably not react the same way a human would. It would not react when we hit it, and it might not be able to walk around. Though the signs of life displayed by them are not very observable, it does not make them non-living.
    
    Let us have a detailed look at the important characteristics of living and non-living things and the difference between the two.</p>

    <p><strong> Living things </strong></p>
    Living things exist and are alive and are made of microscopic structures called cells. They grow and exhibit movement or locomotion. They experience metabolism, which includes anabolic and catabolic reactions.
    
    Living things are capable of producing a new life which is of their own kind through the process of reproduction. Living things have a particular life span and are not immortal.
    
    Cellular Respiration enables living organisms to acquire energy which is used by cells to perform their functions. They digest food for energy and also excrete waste from the body. Their life cycle can be summarised as follows – birth, growth, reproduction and death.
    
    Examples of living things are animals, birds, insects, human beings.

<h2>Characteristics of Living Things</h2>

<img src="images/CHARECTERISTICS-OF-LIVING-THINGS.png">

<p>The following are important characteristics of living things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Living things exhibit locomotory motion, they move. Animals are able to move as they possess specialized locomotory organs, for example – Earthworms move through the soil surface through longitudinal and circular muscles.  Plants move in order to catch sunlight for photosynthesis</li>
<li>Living things respire. Respiration is a chemical reaction, which occurs inside cells to release energy from the food. Transport of gases takes place. The food that is ingested through the process of digestion is broken down to release energy that is utilized by the body to produce water and carbon dioxide as by-products.</li>
<li>Living things are sensitive to touch (and other stimuli as well) and have the capability to sense changes in their environment.</li>
<li>They grow. Living things mature and grow through different stages of development.</li>
<li>One of the striking features is that living things are capable of producing offsprings of their own kind through the process of reproduction, wherein genetic information is passed from the parents to the offsprings.</li>
<li>They acquire and fulfil their nutritional requirements to survive through the process of nutrition and digestion, which involves engulfing and digesting the food. Some living organisms are also autotrophic, which means they can harness the sun’s energy to make their food (also known as autotrophs).</li>
<li>The digested food is eliminated from the body through the process of excretion.</li>
</ol>
